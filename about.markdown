I'm a Senior Data Scientist in Zürich working at the intersection of ML/AI and software engineering. I care most about building (AI) systems that are useful, simple and robust.

My background is in geospatial data science and deep learning. I studied Geography at UZH with a physics minor. I started a PhD in deep learning and remote sensing at ETH Zürich, but left early to pursue applied AI work in industry, where I could focus on building and shipping real systems.

These days I work on document AI systems, computer vision applications, and the engineering challenges of making ML work reliably in production. I contribute to open source projects like [Bazel build library](https://github.com/datahouse/bazel_buildlib) and [bazel-watcher](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher), helping bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and systems that deliver value.

## Background

- **Education**: MSc Geography (UZH), PhD studies in Deep Learning & Remote Sensing (ETH, incomplete)
- **Focus**: Practical ML/AI engineering, document AI, build systems
- **Technical Skills**:
  - **Programming**: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Starlark](https://bazel.build/rules/language), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - **ML/AI Frameworks**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
  - **Build & Deployment**: [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)), [Drone](https://www.drone.io/)
  - **Automation & Tooling**: [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/)
- **Languages**: German (native), English, French
- **Open Source**: Bazel ecosystem contributor

When I’m not on the computer, you’ll usually find me climbing. I’m also the former drummer of the rock band [Annie Taylor](https://www.annietaylorband.com/)—I recorded two albums and played shows around europe with them before stepping back to focus on my work in AI.
